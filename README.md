# vagrant-salt-prototype

This repo will hold the prototype of how we can make use of vagrant with
saltstack as a provisioner to launch the a web service. The web service
would have a database layer and a webserver layer. Optionally it can also
have a monitoring and load balancer layer.

Here we make use vagrant with virtualbox to launch the vms and use the
saltstack provisioner to provision the vms.
